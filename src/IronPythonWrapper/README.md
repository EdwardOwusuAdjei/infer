# Usage

Make sure folders containing `InferNetWrapper.py` and Infer.NET binaries are present among the python's search paths.

# Running Tests and Examples

* Build `Infer2.sln` using the `Release` configuration, so that Infer.NET binaries will become present in `/Compiler/bin/Release` folder.
* Open `TestWrapper.sln` for tests or `InferNetExamples.sln` for examples.
* Run the only project in the opened solution.
